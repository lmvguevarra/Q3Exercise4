	<p>This trip was a very fun experience since it was my first trip out of the country after 4years! These photos were my favorite ones because I rememeber what happened in that day with just one look at it. In the first photo, we went to a hanging bridge. Unfortunately I wasn't able to take an actual photo on the hanging bridge because I was too scared to take my phone out because I am a very clumsy person. If I took my phone out, I would've probably just drop it. The second photo and third photo are connected. The second photo was taken before we went to a cable car to go on top of the snowy mountins of Whistler, Canada. The fourth phot was during a car ride. No story to that, I just thought i looked pretty XD. The fifth and sixth photo were taken at the same place, but different day. All we did is we went shopping and bought pasalubong for family and friends. The seventh and eight were also taken in the same place but different day. They were both taken in Whistler Village. My tita and I just went shopping most of the times we were in Whistler and we ate a lot of pastas and burgers. </p>
